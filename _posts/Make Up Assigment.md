The makeup assignment consists of a series of question and answers over the various topics that were covered.  This was the first day of Data Sources and Storage in which relational databases was main topic.  

To begin with, please review the attached slides for the day you missed.  If you have any questions about the course content or makeup work, please do not hesitate to ask but I would also recommend searching online for additional sources as there are many good references on the topics below.

The following are some short answer (2-4 paragraph unless specified) questions for you to answer.  Most questions apply to the covered material however because some of the content is difficult to provide makeup work for I have substituted 1-2 topics which will require independent research.  All of the questions are well known/documented in the industry and should be easy to locate online.

Please be sure to include supporting statements or examples as necessary.  In general, I'm looking to see how well you grasp the knowledge area, the context in which it exists, as well the benefits it offers.

Please provide your work in the form of a PDF or other document format (and not as the body of an email).

ACID

● Treats a series (1+) of operations as one
atomic transaction - all or nothing
● Not all databases are “transactional”
● Undoing the work of a transaction is known
as “rollback”
● A “commit” finalizes a successful transaction
